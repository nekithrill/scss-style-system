/// Theme map for light mode
///
/// Defines color values for different UI elements following the structure
/// specified in `$theme-required-keys`.
///
/// - Can include colors for headers, footers, buttons, text, etc.
/// - Used with `validate-theme()` to ensure all required keys are present.
/// - Allows generating CSS variables for theming (light, dark, or custom themes).
///
/// Notes:
/// - Theme maps can be extended or modified for different projects.
/// - Helps maintain consistent styling across all components.
